AweNetInstallFlash
=====================

Commandline program and library to check if Flash is configured for .NET [Awesomium](http://www.awesomium.com) and installs it if not.

This program requires that Awesomium libraries are installed to a shared location or the same path as this program.  In a typical installation scenario, this program should be run after installing your Awesomium-based product.

If you want to check if Flash is installed from within your program, use AwesomiumFlashChecker.cs and see Program.cs for example usage.
